# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 20th September, 2020

**Today's progress**: Worked on a README for a FAC20 side project, Trouble Shooter API

**Thoughts:** Really pleased with how the project is shaping up, translating a flow diagram of yes/no choices into a format that can be stored with SQL and sent as an simple (i.e. un-nested object). The README is off to a great start, today we got most of the "Contributing to this project" section done as well as starting on the API docs. I think it's great to write a README first as it helps to clarify what the user can expect and how they can interact, before jumping in to build anything.
